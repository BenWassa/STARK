# üß© STARK ‚Äî Fitness Intelligence, Simplified

STARK is a **static Progressive Web App (PWA)** that runs entirely in the browser.  
It transforms physiological metrics into a clear visual story of fitness and recovery ‚Äî no servers, no tracking, just data and design.

---

## üåü Vision

To make self-quantification simple, transparent, and meaningful.  
STARK turns complex performance data into an elegant dashboard where users can explore:

- **Fitness Index** ‚Äî composite score of total physical capacity  
- **Domain Insights** ‚Äî strength, endurance, power, mobility, body composition, recovery  
- **VO‚ÇÇ Max + Fitness Age** ‚Äî contextualized using population norms  
- **Trend Visualization** ‚Äî progress mapped over time  
- **Offline Access** ‚Äî full functionality without internet
- **Privacy First** ‚Äî all data stored locally using IndexedDB, no cloud sync

## üöÄ Deployment

### Automated Deployment (Recommended)
STARK uses **GitHub Actions** for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages. Simply push your changes to the `main` branch and the deployment happens automatically!

**Workflow:**
1. Push code changes to `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions automatically builds the project
3. Built files are deployed to GitHub Pages
4. Your PWA is live at `https://benwassa.github.io/STARK/`

### Manual Development (Local Testing)

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm 8+

#### Option 1: Standard npm (Linux/Mac/WSL)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev          # Start development server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build        # Build for production (outputs to ../docs)
npm run test         # Run Vitest unit suite
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run check-versions  # Verify all version files are consistent
```

#### Option 2: Windows PowerShell (Security Policy Workaround)
```powershell
cd frontend
# Use full path to npm.cmd (adjust path based on your Node.js installation)
& "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\node-v22.20.0-win-x64\npm.cmd" install
& "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\node-v22.20.0-win-x64\npm.cmd" run dev
& "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\node-v22.20.0-win-x64\npm.cmd" run build
& "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\node-v22.20.0-win-x64\npm.cmd" run test
```

### GitHub Pages Setup
1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Pages** section  
3. Set **Source** to `GitHub Actions`
4. Save changes

The site will be available at `https://benwassa.github.io/STARK/`

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Mode

STARK includes a **development mode** for faster testing and debugging. Dev mode provides additional tools and skips the onboarding flow.

### Enabling Dev Mode

**Option 1: URL Parameter (Recommended)**
```
https://benwassa.github.io/STARK/?dev=true
```

**Option 2: Local Development Server**
```bash
# Start local dev server
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Then visit with dev parameter:
# http://localhost:5173/?dev=true
```

**Option 3: Dev HTML File**
```bash
# Open docs/dev.html directly in browser
# Dev mode automatically enabled - no URL parameters needed!
# Works with any local server or VS Code Live Server
```

**Option 4: Persistent (localStorage)**
```javascript
// Run in browser console, then refresh
localStorage.setItem('starkDevMode', 'true');
```

### Dev Mode Features

When dev mode is active, you'll see:
- üè∑Ô∏è **"DEV" badge** in the header
- üóëÔ∏è **Clear Data button** (red trash icon) - Reset all app data instantly
- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Run Onboarding button** (blue play icon) - Test onboarding flow
- üóÑÔ∏è **Load Mock Data button** (green database icon) - Populate with realistic sample data
- üìã **Console logs** confirming dev mode activation and available tools

### Dev Workflow

```bash
1. Enable dev mode (?dev=true or use dev.html)
2. Click "Load Mock Data" for instant testing with realistic values
3. Test features with sample data across all fitness domains
4. Click "Run Onboarding" to test the complete user setup flow
5. Click "Clear Data" to reset and start fresh
6. Make changes and iterate quickly
```

**Dev mode is completely hidden in production and only accessible via URL parameters, localStorage, or dev.html.**

## üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance

### Version Consistency Check
```bash
npm run check-versions
```
Validates that version numbers are synchronized across:
- `package.json`
- `manifest.json`  
- App footer display

### Manual Testing Checklist
- ‚úÖ Onboarding flow completion
- ‚úÖ Data persistence across sessions
- ‚úÖ PWA installation and offline functionality
- ‚úÖ Metric/Imperial unit conversion
- ‚úÖ Data export and import
- ‚úÖ Responsive design on mobile/tablet/desktop

## üìñ Data Sources & Calculations

### Normative Data
STARK uses evidence-based fitness norms from:
- **ACSM (American College of Sports Medicine)** guidelines
- Population fitness assessment standards
- Age and gender-stratified percentile tables

**Dataset Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17  
**Location:** `frontend/src/data/exercise_metrics.json`

### Calculation Methods

**Fitness Index**  
Weighted composite score across all domains:
```javascript
fitnessIndex = (
  strength √ó 0.20 + 
  endurance √ó 0.25 + 
  power √ó 0.15 + 
  mobility √ó 0.10 + 
  bodyComp √ó 0.15 + 
  recovery √ó 0.15
)
```

**VO‚ÇÇ Max Estimation**  
Multiple estimation methods supported:
- Cooper 12-minute run test
- 1.5-mile run time
- Direct measurement input

**Fitness Age**  
Calculated using VO‚ÇÇ max percentile mapping to age-based norms, cross-referenced with gender-specific cardiovascular fitness tables.

**Z-Score Normalization**  
All metrics converted to standardized z-scores, then mapped to percentiles for consistent comparison across different measurement types.

## üîê Privacy & Security

- **100% Client-Side**: All computations happen in your browser
- **Zero Tracking**: No analytics, cookies, or third-party scripts
- **Local Storage**: Data never leaves your device
- **No Backend**: No servers, databases, or APIs to compromise
- **Offline First**: Full functionality without internet after initial load
- **Open Source**: Complete transparency in code and calculations

---

## üöß Known Limitations

- **Browser Storage**: Limited by IndexedDB quota (~50MB typical, varies by browser)
- **No Cloud Sync**: Data doesn't sync across devices (by design for privacy)
- **Manual Entry**: All metrics require manual input (no wearable integration yet)
- **Static Norms**: Normative data is fixed at build time, not dynamically updated
